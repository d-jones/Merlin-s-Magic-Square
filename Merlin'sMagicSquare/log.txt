Problem: I had trouble getting my seekbars to work properly. I had the correct
value for the color, but it wasn't changing.

Resources used: I went to professor vegdahl
s office and he wlked me though it to get it working. Didn't take too much tweaking.


Other Resources used (altogether):
The only outside help (codewise) I recieve was looking at the Java/Android 
API (A LOT).
HOWEVER, I did however have to look at a specific code example for the alert
dialogs I used for alert3x3() and alert5x5(). 
The link is as follows: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16191562/display-textview-in-alert-dialog

Also: I found the "whoosh" noise at http://soundbible.com/2068-Woosh.html.
It was created by Mark Diangelo.

Also: I found the background music at http://gamethemesongs.com/.
